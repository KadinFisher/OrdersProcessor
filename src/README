If concurrent input is selected by user then each order will be individually processed by a seperated thread concurrently. 
Otherwise, all execution will be processed linearly by main method and internal methods.
example1.txt → A sample order.
example2.txt → A sample order.
example3.txt → A sample order.
itemsData.txt → Information about the items that can be purchased.
resultsExample.txt → Results of processing the above example1.txt, example2.txt, and example3.txt orders.
Regardless of numerical order of the orders, results will always be printed in correct numerical order.
